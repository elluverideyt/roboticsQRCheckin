# VCS Robotics Check In Service

This repository contains a Check In service designed for VCS Robotics meetings. Each meeting generates a unique QR code, which attendees scan to check in and check out, ensuring accurate session tracking and enhanced security.

## Features

- **Dynamic QR Code Generation**: A new QR code is created for each meeting to prevent reuse and enhance security.
- **Check In**: Scan the QR code at the beginning of the meeting to register attendance.
- **Check Out**: Scan the QR code again at the end of the meeting to mark your checkout.

## Usage

- On meeting day, open the service to generate a unique QR code.
- **To Check In:** Scan the QR code as you enter the meeting.
- **To Check Out:** Scan the same QR code at the end of the meeting session.

Ensure that the QR code is refreshed for each new meeting to maintain session integrity.
